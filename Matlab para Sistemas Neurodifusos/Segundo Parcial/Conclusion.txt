The kohonen neural network proved to be adequate for the process of recognizing images for the direction of a cart, it because the patterns had a very easy to notice feature and it was that at be arrows there were a large number of pixels were concentrated in one of the edges, thus delimiting the patterns in sets by their similarities, however in the training if the initial weights were not chosen correctly we will have an incorrect result due there was not known in which set each weight fell and in some cases it was not possible identify it correctly giving an incorrect direction.
